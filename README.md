# interactive-rpg-character-sheet
WIP interactive modular character sheet for a tabletop role-playing game

This is a personal project intended to provide an online interactive character sheet for the popular tabletop role-playing game (RPG) Pathfinder, by Paizo Inc.

Project goal is to simplify the bookkeeping on characters, enabling instant tracking amd updating of changes such as magical buffs, form changes, and conditional modifiers where they apply.

To be completed:
-Continue replacing lookup tables with calculations wherever possible
-Pivot character size to numeric version rather than text
-Add adjustments to encumbrance values for differently-sized and quadrupedal characters
-Bonus- and penalty-tracking system, including generating write-ups of conditional effects
-Character class processing, including saves and base attack bonus
-Web page display
-Load/save character data (optional)
-Separate Model code into own file
-Separate View + Controller code into own file (allowing for different View & Controller code working from same module)
-Mechanism for adding character classes
-Code documentation
